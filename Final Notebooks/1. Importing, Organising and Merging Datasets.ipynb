    "I have been concerned with the Syrian Civil War and the ensuing refugee crisis, since the start of the conflict in 2011 when I was a student of Arabic at University of Edinburgh. Since then, I have worked directly with displaced people from this and other conflicts in Egypt, Lebanon and Greece. Whilst working with unaccompanied asylum-seeking children in Greece, I observed first hand the country's struggles to integrate asylum-seeking children into its national school system, and ultimately focused on this for my [Master's dissertation](https://sophieespencer.wordpress.com/2019/09/02/growth-unlocked/). In this dissertation, I identified the specific learning needs of refugee and asylum-seeking children as psycho-social support, protection from discrimination and bullying, and language acquisiton support. I also reviewed how other countries with high numbers of asylum-seeking children were addressing this challenge. \n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequently, I wanted to undertake a comparative investigation of countries with high numbers of asylum-seeking children to understand which countries were most successful at integrating foreign-born children into their national school systems. In the following analysis, I use data from the IEA’s Progress in International Reading Literacy Study 2021 (PIRLS 2021), an international assessment of fourth-grade students’ reading abilities conducted across 57 countries, to assess literacy outcomes for native and foreign-born children across nine countries with significant refugee populations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this study is to serve as a preliminary quantitative investigation to identify countries that demonstrate best practice in integrating foreign-born children into their national school systems, so that further targeted investigations into successful policies and practices can be made.

    "PIRLS (Progress in International Reading Literacy Study) is a global assessment of reading proficiency among fourth graders, conducted every five years since its inception in 2001. In the 2021 cycle, nearly 400,000 children from 57 countries participated. Beyond reading assessments, PIRLS includes context questionnaires for students, parents, teachers, and schools, offering invaluable insights into the realities of learning environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have chosen to use PIRLS data for this analysis because my primary focus is literacy—a skill that opens countless opportunities for individuals, enabling them to fully engage with the world around them. Additionally, testing fourth-grade children—who are typically around ten years old—is meaningful as they should have grasped the basics of reading and writing at this stage.\n",

    "To keep the analysis manageable, I want to focus on approximately 10 countries.

    "\n",
    "While I was hoping to include Greece as a continuation of research I undertook for my [Master's dissertation](https://sophieespencer.wordpress.com/2019/09/02/growth-unlocked/), Greece did not take part in PIRLS 2021. Additionally, although my home country, England, did participate, it did not conduct the Home Context questionnaire, which reveals a child's nativity status. \n",
    "\n",
    "After an initial review of the datasets using the codebooks  [here](https://pirls2021.org/data/) - I have chosen to use the Home Context Survey data (answered by parents) and the Student Context Survey data (answered by students) as the primary data sources for this examination. Conveniently, the Student Context Data included the aggregated assessment scores for each child, making it unnecessary to use the original assessment score dataset.\n",
